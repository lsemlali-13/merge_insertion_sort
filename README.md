# merge_insertion_sort

This repository contains the implementation of the Ford-Johnson algorithm, also known as Merge Insertion Sort. This algorithm is a comparison sort that aims to minimize the worst-case number of comparisons for small datasets. Although it might not be the fastest or the most memory efficient, it is particularly useful in scenarios where the cost of comparison significantly outweighs the overhead of the algorithm, such as when each comparison is extremely expensive, for example, making a network request, querying a database, or asking for human input
